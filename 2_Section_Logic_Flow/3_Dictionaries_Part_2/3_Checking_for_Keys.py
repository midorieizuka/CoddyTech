"""
When working with dictionaries, you often need to check if a specific key exists.
Python provides simple ways to check for the presence of keys in a dictionary.

Using the in keyword:

my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}

# Check if 'name' is a key in the dictionary
if 'name' in my_dict:
    print('Name exists in the dictionary')

# Check if 'city' is a key in the dictionary
if 'city' not in my_dict:
    print('City does not exist in the dictionary')

In this example, we use the in keyword to check if 'name' is one of the keys in my_dict.
We also use not in to check if 'city' is not a key in the dictionary.

Using the keys() method:
my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}

# Check if 'age' is in the list of keys
if 'age' in my_dict.keys():
    print('Age exists in the dictionary')

Here, my_dict.keys() returns a list of all keys in the dictionary, and we use in to check if 'age' is in that list.

You are managing a dictionary of employee data, where each key is an employee's name and the value is their department.
Your task is to:

Check if "Alice" is a key in the dictionary.
If it exists, print: "Alice is in the company."
Check if "John" is not a key in the dictionary.
If it does not exist, print: "John is not in the company."

employees = {"Alice": "HR", "Bob": "Engineering", "Diana": "Marketing"}

# Write code here
if "Alice" in employees.keys():
    print("Alice is in the company.")
if "John" not in employees.keys():
    print("John is not in the company.")
