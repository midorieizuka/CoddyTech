"""
Write a recursive function named print_sequence that takes a positive integer n as an argument and prints a countdown sequence.
For each number from n to 1, it should print 'T-minus {number}'.
When it reaches 0, it should print 'Blast off!'. For example, if n is 3, the output should be:

T-minus 3
T-minus 2
T-minus 1
Blast off!
