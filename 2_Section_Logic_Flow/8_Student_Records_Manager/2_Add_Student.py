"""
Create a function named add_student that takes three arguments: name (string), age (integer), and courses (a list of strings).
The function should:

Check if the student name already exists in the student_records dictionary. If it does, print "Student '<name>' already exists.".
If the name does not exist, add it to student_records with age, an empty set for grades, and a set of courses.
Print "Student '<name>' added successfully.".

Add the following block of code at the bottom of your code:

add_student("Alice", 20, ["Math", "Physics"])
add_student("Bob", 22, ["Biology", "Chemistry"])
print(student_records)
"""

student_records = {}

def add_student(name, age, courses):
    if name in student_records:
        print(f"Student {name} already exists.")
    else:
        student_records[name] = {"age": age, "grades": set(), "courses": set(courses)}
        print(f"Student '{name}' added successfully.")

add_student("Alice", 20, ["Math", "Physics"])
add_student("Bob", 22, ["Biology", "Chemistry"])
print(student_records)
