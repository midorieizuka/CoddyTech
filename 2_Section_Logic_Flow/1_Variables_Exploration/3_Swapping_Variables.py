Swapping variables is a common operation where the values of two variables are exchanged.
Python offers a simple and elegant way to swap variables without needing a temporary variable, unlike many other programming languages.

Traditional Method (Using a Temporary Variable):
a = 10
b = 20
temp = a
a = b
b = temp
print(a)  # Output: 20
print(b)  # Output: 10

Pythonic Way (Simultaneous Assignment):
a = 10
b = 20
a, b = b, a
print(a)  # Output: 20
print(b)  # Output: 10

In the Pythonic way, the values of b and a are simultaneously assigned to a and b, respectively.
This approach is more readable and doesn't require any additional variables.

Write a Python program to swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable.
Initialize two variables, x and y, with the values 5 and 10 respectively.
Swap their values and then print them.
"""

# Initialize variables x and y
x = 5
y = 10

# Swap the values of x and y
x, y = y, x

# Print the swapped values
print(f"x: {x}")
print(f"y: {y}")
