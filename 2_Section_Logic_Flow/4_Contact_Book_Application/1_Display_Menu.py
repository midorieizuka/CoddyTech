"""
In this project, we will build a Contact Book application step by step by breaking it into small, manageable functions.
The first step is to create a display_menu function.

Create a function named display_menu that prints the main menu options for the Contact Book.

The menu should include the following options:

Add Contact
View Contact
Edit Contact
Delete Contact
List All Contacts
Exit
This function will be the starting point of the program, helping users navigate through the options.
