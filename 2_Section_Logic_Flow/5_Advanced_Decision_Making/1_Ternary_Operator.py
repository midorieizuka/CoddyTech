"""
The ternary operator is a concise way to write simple if-else statements in a single line.
It's a shorthand method that can make your code more compact and readable when used appropriately.

The syntax of the ternary operator is:

value_if_true if condition else value_if_false

Here's how it works:

If the condition is true, the expression evaluates to value_if_true.
If the condition is false, the expression evaluates to value_if_false.

For example:

age = 20
status = "Eligible" if age >= 18 else "Not Eligible"
print(status)

In this example, if age is greater than or equal to 18, status will be assigned the value "Eligible".
Otherwise, it will be assigned "Not Eligible".

The ternary operator is particularly useful for simple conditional assignments where you want to choose between two values based on a condition.

Create a program that takes an integer score from the user.
The program should use the ternary operator to determine the status based on the score:

If the score is greater than or equal to 50, the status should be "Pass".
If the score is less than 50, the status should be "Fail".
The program should output the determined status.

score = int(input())
status = "Pass" if score >= 50 else "Fail"
print(status)
