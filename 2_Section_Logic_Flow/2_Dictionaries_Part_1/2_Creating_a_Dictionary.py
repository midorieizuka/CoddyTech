"""
To create a dictionary in Python, you use curly braces {} and specify the key-value pairs within them.
Each key-value pair is written as key: value, and multiple pairs are separated by commas.

Here's how you can create a dictionary:

# Creating a dictionary of country capitals
country_capitals = {
    "USA": "Washington, D.C.",
    "France": "Paris",
    "Japan": "Tokyo"
}

# Creating a dictionary of employee information
employee = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "position": "Software Engineer"
}

# Creating an empty dictionary
empty_dict = {}

In the first example, country_capitals is a dictionary with country names as keys and their capitals as values.
In the second example, employee is a dictionary containing information about an employee.
The third example shows how to create an empty dictionary, which can be useful when you want to add items to it later.

Create a function named create_student_dict that takes three parameters: name, age, and major.
The function should return a dictionary where the keys are "name", "age", and "major", and the values are the corresponding values passed to the function.

For example, calling create_student_dict("Alice", 20, "Computer Science") should return a dictionary with the following key-value pairs:

Key: "name", Value: "Alice"
Key: "age", Value: 20
Key: "major", Value: "Computer Science"
"""

def create_student_dict(name, age, major):
    # Write code here
    dictionary = {
        "name": name,
        "age": age,
        "major": major
    }
    return dictionary

name = input()
age = int(input())
major = input()

print(create_student_dict(name, age, major))
