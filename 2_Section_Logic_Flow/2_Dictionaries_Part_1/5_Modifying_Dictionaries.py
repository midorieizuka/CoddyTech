"""
Dictionaries in Python are not static; you can modify them after they are created.
You can add new key-value pairs, update existing ones, or delete them.

Adding a new key-value pair:
# Start with an empty dictionary
my_dict = {}

# Add a new key-value pair
my_dict["name"] = "Alice"
my_dict["age"] = 30

print(my_dict)
# Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}

Updating an existing value:
# Update the age
my_dict["age"] = 31

print(my_dict)
# Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 31}

Deleting a key-value pair:
# Delete the age
del my_dict["age"]

print(my_dict)
# Output: {'name': 'Alice'}

In these examples, we first add a new key-value pair to an empty dictionary.
Then, we update the value of an existing key.
Finally, we delete a key-value pair using the del keyword.

Create a function named update_employee_info that takes three parameters: employee_dict (a dictionary), key (a string), and value.
The function should update the employee_dict with the new key and value. If the key already exists, its value should be updated.
If the key does not exist, a new key-value pair should be added.
The function should return the updated dictionary.
