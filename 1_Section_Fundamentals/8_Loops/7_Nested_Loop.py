"""
A nested loop is a loop inside another loop. The inner loop completes all its iterations for each iteration of the outer loop.

Let's create a simple nested loop:

# Outer loop
for i in range(3):
    print(f"Outer loop iteration: {i}")
    
    # Inner loop
    for j in range(2):
        print(f"  Inner loop iteration: {j}")
When you run this code, you'll see:

Outer loop iteration: 0
  Inner loop iteration: 0
  Inner loop iteration: 1
Outer loop iteration: 1
  Inner loop iteration: 0
  Inner loop iteration: 1
Outer loop iteration: 2
  Inner loop iteration: 0
  Inner loop iteration: 1

Notice that for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop completes all of its iterations.

Write a function named print_pattern that prints a rectangle pattern of stars (*).

The function should:

Take two parameters: rows and cols (both integers)
Use nested loops to print a rectangle with the given dimensions
Each row should contain cols stars
The pattern should have rows rows in total
Example output for print_pattern(3, 4):
