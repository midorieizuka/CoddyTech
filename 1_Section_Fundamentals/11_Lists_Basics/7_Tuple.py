"""
A tuple is an immutable (read-only) ordered collection of elements. Unlike lists, once created, tuples cannot be modified.

Create a tuple with parentheses:

fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
You can also create a tuple without parentheses:

colors = "red", "green", "blue"
Access tuple elements using indexing (just like lists):

first_fruit = fruits[0]  # "apple"
Remember, tuples are immutable, so you cannot modify elements: 

# This will cause an error
# fruits[0] = "orange"
A tuple with a single element needs a trailing comma:
"""

single_item = ("apple",)  # This is a tuple
not_a_tuple = ("apple")   # This is a string
