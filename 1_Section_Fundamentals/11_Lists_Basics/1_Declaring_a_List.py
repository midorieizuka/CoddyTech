"""
A list is a collection of items, and it can contain values of different types, such as numbers, strings, or even other lists. Lists are created using square brackets [], and the items inside the list are separated with commas.

Here is an example of how to create a list:

my_list = [1, 2, "three", True]
To check the length of the list, we can use the len() function:

length = len(my_list)
The variable length will hold 4 because there are 4 elements in the list.

# Create a list called shopping_list that contains the following items: bread, eggs, milk, and butter.

shopping_list = ["bread", "eggs", "milk", "butter"]
