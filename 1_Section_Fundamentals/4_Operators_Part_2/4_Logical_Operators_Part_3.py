"""
You're helping a weather app determine suitable outdoor activities based on weather conditions.

Create a program that uses logical operations to determine if certain activities are possible.

Initialize the following variables:

is_sunny with the value True
temperature with the value 25
wind_speed with the value 10
water_temperature with the value 22
Write the following logical expressions to determine if:

can_go_hiking: It's sunny AND temperature is above 15째C AND wind speed is below 20 km/h
can_go_swimming: It's sunny AND temperature is above 20째C AND water temperature is above 18째C
cannot_go_outside: It's NOT sunny OR temperature is below 10째C OR wind speed is above 30 km/h
"""
# Initialize variables
is_sunny = True
temperature = 25
wind_speed = 10
water_temperature = 22

# Calculate conditions
can_go_hiking = is_sunny == True and temperature > 15 and wind_speed < 20
can_go_swimming = is_sunny == True and temperature > 20 and water_temperature > 18
cannot_go_outside = is_sunny == False or temperature < 10 or wind_speed > 30
