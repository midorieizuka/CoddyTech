"""
FizzBuzz is a simple and classic programming game often used to teach basic logic and control flow.

The game involves iterating through numbers from 1 up to a specified limit. For each number:

If the number is divisible by 3, the program outputs "Fizz."
If the number is divisible by 7, it outputs "Buzz."
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 7, it outputs "FizzBuzz."

Otherwise, it simply outputs the number.

This game is an excellent way to practice using loops, conditionals, and modular arithmetic.
