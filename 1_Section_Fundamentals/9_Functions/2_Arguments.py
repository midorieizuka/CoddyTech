"""
An argument in a function is a value that you pass into the function when you call it. To add arguments to a function, we write them inside the parenthesis ():

def function_name(arg1, arg2, ...):
    code
We can name the arguments as we want, and we can write as many arguments as we need.

To call a function and pass arguments to it, we write:

function_name(value1, value2, value3, ...)
Passing too many arguments to a function that is expecting less arguments will cause the program to fail

Example of usage:

def is_even(number):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print(f"{number} is even")
    else:
        print(f"{number} is odd")

for i in range(15, 34):
    is_even(i)
for i in range(153, 219):
    is_even(i)

Here we have a function called is_even that accepts one argument called number and prints if the number is even or odd.
Then we call the function twice: one time for all the numbers between 15 and 34, and the second time for all the numbers between 153 and 219.

Write a program that takes two numbers as input. These input numbers will be used as arguments for the function described below.

Create a function that gets two arguments, calculates their product, and prints the result. You can name the function as you wish.

Call the function using the input numbers.
