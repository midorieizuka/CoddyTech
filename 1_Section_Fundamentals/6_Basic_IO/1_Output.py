"""
We have already seen how to output something, but let's recap.

In programming it's often called "printing" to output something.

In Python, to print something to the screen we use print()

For example,

print("Hello")

The above example prints "Hello" to screen.

Recall that you must enclose what you want to print with "" or with '', it is a string inside the print().
